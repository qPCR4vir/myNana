# Install myNana
1. go to [myNana master](https://nanapro.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/qPCR4vir/myNana)
2. Download or clone the branch master into your working directory of choise (for example: C:\Prog\ExtLib\Nana) 
3. Copy the whole dir Nana.Cpp11\build\vc2012\PropertySheet into the directory two level before the nana directory 
(to get something like: C:\Prog\PropertySheet). Two level because I use this PropertySheets for both my projects and for external projects or libraries.
4. Open C:\Prog\ExtLib\Nana\Nana.Cpp11\build\vc2012\nana.sln with MSVS2013. Now you can start to modify nana, or you can add a new project to write programs using nana.
