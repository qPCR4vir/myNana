\section exam Examples
\subsection HelloN Hello Nana 
Let's start with a simple program, we will study it line by line. 

	1 #include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	2 #include <nana/gui/widgets/label.hpp> 
	3 int main() 
	4 { 
	5 	nana::gui::form form; 
	6 	nana::gui::label label(form, 0, 0, 100, 20); 
	7 	label.caption(STR("Hello Nana")); 
	8 	form.show(); 
	9 	nana::gui::exec(); 
	  } 

Lines 1 and 2 include the definitions of class `form` and class `label` in namespace nana::gui. 
Every GUI application written with Nana C++ Library must include the header file nana/gui/wvl.hpp. 

Line 5 defines a nana::gui::form object. It is a window used for placing a label widget in this example. 

Line 6 defines a nana::gui::label object to display a text string. The label object is created in the form. A widget is a visual element in the user interface. 

Line 7 sets the caption of label object. Every widget has a caption for displaying a title. In this line, there is a string within a macro named STR, 
this macro is a string wrapper used for easy switch the application between UNICODE and ASCII version. 

Line 8 makes the form visible. 

Line 9 passes the control of the application on to Nana. At this point, the program enters the event loop for waiting for
and receiving a user action, such as mouse move, mouse click and keyboard press. The function nana::gui::exec blocks till
form is destroyed, and the example demonstrate is that program exits when a user closes the window. 

![Figure 1.1 Hello Nana](HelloNana.jpg)

Now, you can run the program on your own machine. But firstly you should have Nana C++ Library 
installed in your system. A method to install is explained in Installation Library Documentation 
in Nana Programmer`s Guide. 

\subsection Event Making An Event  
The second example shows how to respond a user action. To receive a user action, an event 
handler should be registered to a widget. Nana waits for a user action and invokes the event 
handler of corresponding event. The application consists of a button that the user can click to quit. 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp> 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		button btn(fm, 0, 0, 100, 20); 
		btn.caption(STR("Quit")); 
		btn.make_event<events::click>(API::exit); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

This source code is similar to Hello Nana, except that we are using a button instead of a label, and 
we are making an event to respond a user click. Every widget class has a set of methods to make events, 
they are named "make_event". This is a function template. The first template parameter specifie what 
event must be given explicitly when calling the function, and the parameter of the member function is an 
event handler. As above code shown, we make the API::exit() as an event handler for the button's click event. 
The exit() function is an API in Nana C++ Library. It closes all windows in current GUI thread and terminates 
the event loop. It will be called when the user clicks the button. 

![Figure 1.2 Event Example](Quit.jpg)
 

\section Functor Function Objects  

This chapter shows two basic concepts: function object and lambda. Function object is a requirement to understand Nana C++ Library. 

A Function Object, or Functor (the two terms are synonymous) is simply any object that can be called as 
if it is a function, more generally, so is an object of a class that defines function call operator(). 

The function object is an impressive technology. A function object is a more general concept than a function 
because a function object can have state that persist across several calls and can be initialized and examined 
from outside the object, unlike a static local variable. For example: 

	class sum 
	{ public: 
		sum() : i_(0) {} 
		operator int() const volatile { return i_; } 
					   //this makes the objects of this class can be used like a function. 
		void operator()(int x) volatile { i_ += x; } 
	  private: 
		int i_; 
	}; 

	void foo(const std::vector<int>& v) 
	{ 			//gather the sum of all elements. 
	   std::cout<<std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), sum())<<std::endl; 
	} 

std::for_each() returns a copy of the object of sum, and we are able to retrieve the state or result. 
On the basis of this feature that function objects retain its own state, it is easy used for concurrency 
process, and it is extensively used for providing flexibility in the library implementation. 

Nana C++ Library uses a large number of function objects to make the framework work. 
To make the framework flexible enough, Nana C++ Library introduced a general functor class template: 

	template<typename Ftype> class nana::functor; 

The template parameter Ftype specify what function type the functor delegates. By using the functor 
class template, we are able to make Nana C++ Library get rid of types that involved. For example: 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <iostream> 
	void foo() 
	{ 
		std::system("cls"); 
		std::cout<<"foo"<<std::endl; 
	} 
	void foo_with_eventinfo(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	{ 
	  std::cout << "foo_with_eventinfo, mouse pos = ("
	   << ei.mouse.x  << ", "  <<  ei.mouse.y  << ")" << std::endl; 
	} 
	class click_stat 
	{ public: 
		click_stat(): n_(0) {} 
		void respond   ()   { std::cout<<"click_stat = "<<++n_<<std::endl; } 
		void respond_ei(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
		{ 
			 std::cout << "click_state width eventinfo = " << n_ 
			<< ", mouse pos = ("  <<ei.mouse.x<<", "<<ei.mouse.y<<")"
			<< std::endl; 
		} 
	 private: 
	   int n_; 
	}; 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		typedef nana::functor<void()> 				    fun_t; 
		typedef nana::functor<void(const eventinfo&)> 	fun_with_param_t; 
		form 		fm; 
		click_stat 	cs; 
		fun_t 		f(foo); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(f); 
		f = fun_t(cs, &click_stat::respond); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(f); 
		fun_with_param_t fp(foo_with_eventinfo); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(fp); 
		fp = fun_with_param_t(cs, &click_stat::respond_ei); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(fp); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

There are four different types of event handlers that can be processed by using nana::functor 
class template. It is flexible and reduce the complexity of study and use. 

![Figure 2.1 Various methods to make events to respond click.] (make_event.jpg)

In the previous example, we illustrated the use of nana::functor and the flexibility of using a 
function object. Practically, creating a nana::functor object is not required. Using these 
functions this way instead of creating a nana::functor: 

	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		click_stat cs; 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(foo); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(cs, &click_stat::respond); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(foo_with_eventinfo); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(cs, &click_stat::respond_ei); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

\subsection Predefined Predefined Function Objects 

Nana C++ Library includes many different predefined function objects. Using these 
function objects together with function templates increases the expressive power of 
the library as well as making the resulting code much more efficient. For example, if
a C++ program wants to close the form when the form is being clicked. 

	form.make_event<events::click>(destroy(form)); 

Please include <nana/gui/functional.hpp> before using these function objects. 

	class destroy 
	{ public: 
		destroy(nana::gui::window wd); 
		void operator()() const; 
	}; 

Destroy the window. 

	class hide 
	{ public: 
		hide(nana::gui::window wd); 
		void operator()() const; 
	}; 

Hide the window.
 
	class show 
	{ public: 
		show(nana::gui::window wd); 
		void operator()() const; 
	}; 

Show the window. 

\subsection Lambda The Lambda Expression 

A lambda expression is a mechanism for specifying a function object. The lambda 
is a new feature that introduced into C++ language recently, the primary use for a 
lambda is to specify a simple action to be performed by some functions. For example: 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <iostream> 
	int main() 
	{ 
		nana::gui::form form; 
		form.make_event<nana::gui::events::click>( 
			[]{ std::cout<<"form is clicked"<<std::endl; } 
			); 
		form.show(); 
		nana::gui::exec(); 
	} 

The argument []{ std::cout<<"form is clicked"<<std::endl; } is a "lambda" 
(or "lambda function" or "lambda expression") in C++ language(C++11). A lambda starts with plain [],
and compound-state block {} defines a function body. In fact, A lambda defines an anonymous 
function object, and therefore a lambda could be invoked through a function-call syntax. 

	[]{ std::cout<<"hello, Nana"<<std::endl; }(); 

The use of lambda is creating an anonymous function object and so the arguments should be specified. For example: 

	form.make_event<nana::gui::events::click>( 
			[](const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
			{ std::cout<<"mouse pos=("<<ei.mouse.x<<", "<<ei.mouse.y <<std::endl;} 
		); 

The lambda-declarator () is used like a parameter-list. Let�s stop the introduction to the lambda, if you want more details of lambda, please refer to other C++ books. 



\section forms   Creating forms  

This chapter will teach you how to create a window using Nana C++ Library. 
A window is a visual element in the operation system or window environment. 
Form is a window that like a container can contain other widgets, such as button, 
textbox and listbox. Every GUI program created with the Nana C++ Library need to create one 
form at least, as in examples of chapter 1. Many forms are created by creating an instance of form. 
This way of creating a form is easy, but it will make your program complicated if you want to create a bit larger program.
 
\subsection der Defining a form through Derivation  
Nana C++ Library is implemented using Object-oriented methods. We can define an own form by deriving from nana::gui::form. 

Our first example is a Monty Hall Problem. This is a game that tests you whether change your choice after you picked a door to win a new Car. 

![Figure.  The Monty Hall Problem.](MontyHall.jpg) 

Let�s start creating this application. First we are going to design architecture for the application. 
As we saw in figure 3.1, the application needs a form, a label and three buttons. 

	1 #include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	2 #include <nana/gui/widgets/label.hpp> 
	3 #include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp> 
	4 #include <nana/system/platform.hpp> 
	5 class monty_hall 
	6       : public nana::gui::form 
	7 { 
	8     enum state_t{state_begin, state_picked, state_over}; 
	9   public: 
	10    monty_hall(); 
	11  private: 
	12    void _m_pick_door  (const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei); 
	13    void _m_play       (int door); 
	14    void _m_remove_door(int exclude); 
	15  private: 
	16    state_t    state_; 
	17    int        door_has_car_; 
	18    nana::gui::label  label_; 
	19    nana::gui::button door_[3]; 
	20 }; 
	21 int main() 
	22 { 
	23    monty_hall mh; 
	24    mh.show(); 
	25    nana::gui::exec(); 
	26 } 

Lines 1 to 4 include the headers that are required by this application. 
The wvl.hpp provides the basis of Nana C++ Library that all GUI program required. label.hpp 
and button.hpp include the definitions of label and button, and we will specify the door which 
has the new Car randomly by using timestamp()- platform.hpp provides the timestamp() function. 

Lines 5 to 20 define the class monty_hall. The monty_hall is derived from nana::gui::form, 
in another word, class monty_hall is defined as a form and we will put all handlers in this 
class scope to keep program clear. 

Line 8 defines a state type that contains three states. state_begin is a state that indicates 
the first pick, state_picked indicates the second pick, and state_over indicates the result. 

Line 10 declares a default constructor. It will initialize the widgets and set the initial state. 

Line 12 declares a private member function to respond the user action on buttons. 

Line 13 and 14 declare two private member functions which handle the game logic. We will define them later.
 
Lines 16 to 19 define the data members including label and buttons. The integer member door_has_car_ indicates the number of the door which has a car behind it.
 
Lines 21 to 26 define the main function; an object of class monty_hall is defined, sets the form visible and enters the event loop.
 
Let�s implement the default constructor and three private member functions. 

	27 monty_hall() 
	28        : nana::gui::form(nana::gui::API::make_center(400, 150), 
	29                                                        appear::decorate<appear::taskbar>()) 
	30         ,state_(state_begin) 
	31 { 
	32    this->caption(STR("The Monty Hall Problem")); 
	33    nana::string text = STR("Hi, I am the host, you are on a Game Show:\n") 
	34    STR("You are given the choice of one of tree Doors.\n") 
	35    STR("One door has a new Car behind it and the other two: Goats.\n") 
	36    STR("Now pick a door to win the Car."); 
	37 
	38    label_.create(*this, 0, 0, 400, 100); 
	39    label_.caption(text); 
	40 
	41    nana::string door_name[3] = 
	42                              {STR("Door No.&1"), STR("Door No.&2"), STR("Door No.&3")}; 
	43    for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) 
	44    { 
	45      door_[i].create(*this, 50 + 110 * i, 110, 100, 24); 
	46      door_[i].caption(door_name[i]); 
	47      door_[i].make_event<nana::gui::events::click>(*this, 
	48                                                          &monty_hall::_m_pick_door); 
	49    } 
	50 } 

Line 28 and 29 initialize the base class of monty_hall. make_center() is a function that returns 
a rectangle that specifies an area in the center of screen with size of 400 � 150. The typedef name 
appear is used for the abstraction of form appearance. The appear::decorate defines the form with caption 
bar, border, a close button and displaying in taskbar. 

Line 30 initializes the initial state. 

Line 32 sets the caption of form. 

Lines 33 to 36 define a text that describes the game information. 

Line 38 and 39 create a label widget and set the caption of label. The label will display the text which is defined in line 33. 

Line 41 and 42 define a string array which contains the names of three doors. 

Lines 43 to 48 create the buttons in a loop, and set the caption, make a click event for three buttons. 

	51 void _m_pick_door(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	52 { 
	53 	int index = 0; 
	54 	for(; index < 3; ++index) 
	55 	{ 
	56 		if(door_[index] == ei.window) 
	57 		   break; 
	58 	} 
	59 	_m_play(index); 
	   } 

On line 51, the member function has a parameter, eventinfo that contains the event 
information, such as which widget the event is taking place. We need the information to 
determinate which button is clicked, because the event handler of the three buttons is one 
and the same. 

Lines 53 to 59 find the index of the button which is clicked. The button which is click is specified by ei.window. _m_play() handles the logic of game. 

	60 void _m_play(int door) 
	61 { 
	62    switch(state_) 
	63    { 
	64       case state_begin: 
	65                      door_has_car_ = (nana::system::timestamp() / 1000) % 3; 
	66                      _m_remove_door(door); 
	67                      state_ = state_picked; 
	68                 break; 
	69       case state_picked: 
	70                      label_.caption(door_has_car_ == door ? 
	71                                        STR("Yes, you win the new Car!!") : STR("Sign, you are lost!")); 
	72                      state_ = state_over; 
	73                 break; 
		  } 
	   } 
Line 60 defines the _m_play() to handle the logic of this game, it contains a parameter to indicate 
what the number of door is picked. There are two states we would handle, state_begin indicates the 
first pick, and now, program should put the car behind a door randomly, use the timestamp() function 
to retrieve the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since system was started, we use the number 
to implement randomization, and find the remainder of division of the number by 3 through the modulus 
operation, the last result is the door number which is large or equal to 0 and less than 3. _m_remove_door() 
is used for removing a door excluding the car behind it and the door that is picked. 

Line 67 is setting the next state. 

Line 69 is start of handling the state that gamer plays the second pick. 

Line 70 and 71 test the number of door whether is the door which the car behind it, and set the caption of label by result. 

Line 72 sets the final state. 

In fact, in the lines from 51 to 59, the member function _m_pick_door() can be removed by using 
std::bind(), refer to section 2.3 Think about the Design. By using std::bind(), we can bind the 
the index of door to the _m_play() and make it as the event handler for the click of button. 

	74 void _m_remove_door(int exclude) 
	75 { 
	76 		std::vector<int> doors; 
	77 		for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) 
	78 		{ 
	79 			if(i != exclude) 
	80 				doors.push_back(i); 
	} 
	81 		unsigned ts = (nana::system::timestamp() / 1000) % 2; 
	82 		if(door_has_car_ == doors[ts]) 
	83 			ts = (ts ? 0: 1); 
	84 		door_[doors[ts]].enabled(false); 
	85 		doors.erase(doors.begin() + ts); 
	86 		nana::string text = STR("I know what's behind all the doors and") 
	87 			STR("I remove a door which a goat behind it. \n") 
	88 			STR("And now, do you want to stick with your decision") 
	89 			STR(" of Door No.X or do you want to change your choice") 
	90 			STR(" to Door No.Y?"); 
	91 		nana::char_t door_char = '1' + exclude; 
	92 		nana::string::size_type pos = text.find(STR("Door No.X")); 
	93 		text.replace(pos + 8, 1, 1, door_char); 
	94 		door_char = '1' + doors[0]; 
	95 		pos = text.find(STR("Door No.Y")); 
	96 		text.replace(pos + 8, 1, 1, door_char); 
	97 		label_.caption(text); 
	} 

Line 74 defines the _m_remove_door() to removes a door which is a goat behind it and 
is not picked by gamer. The parameter exclude is a door number that picked by gamer. 

Lines 76 to 80 create a std::vector object that contains the index of doors excluding 
the one of gamer picked. So the result of vector only contains two doors. 

Lines 81 to 85 choose a door in the vector randomly, if the door has a car behind it, 
change the choice to other one, the door which is chosen will be removed. A widget has two methods named enabled(), they are overloading functions void enabled(bool) and 
bool enabled() const, are used for setting or retrieving the state whether the widget can 
receive inputs from mouse and keyboard. If the enabled state of a button is set to false, 
the color of button text becomes gray and the button is not working while clicking on it. 

Lines 86 to 97 prepare the text that asks gamer whether changes his choice after the first pick.
 
Now run the program. Verify that the shortcut keys Alt+1, Alt+2 and Alt+3 trigger the correct behavior. 
Press Tab key to navigate through the buttons with keyboard, the default tabstop order is the order in which the buttons were created. 


\subsection loader Creating An Instance of the Form with form_loader<form>()  
In the previous chapters we provided examples of defining the form objects. 
They are usually local objects. When the local object goes out of scope, its destructor is called automatically. 
Sometimes we need to keep the object alive when it goes out of the scope: another way to create an object is to declare 
a pointer variable to the class of object and call the C++ new operator, which will allocate space for the object 
and call the constructor. In this case, the pointer variable must be explicitly deallocated with the delete operator. 
But the question is when shall we delete the pointer variable? In fact, we can create a form object by using form_loader. 
Nana C++ Library will manage the form objects created by form_loader and destroy the objects when the user closes the form. For example:

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	int main() 
	{ 
	using namespace nana::gui; 
	form_loader<form>()().show(); 
	exec(); 
	} 

nana::gui::form_loader is a template functor class. It creates an object of the template 
parameter class. nana::gui::form_loader is useful when you create a form and don�t want to 
take care about the lifetime of the object. Continuing with the next example, we see a form 
is created when the button is being clicked. 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp> 
	void click() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form_loader<form>()().show(); 
	} 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		button btn(fm, 10, 10, 150, 23); 
		btn.caption(STR("Open a new form")); 
		btn.make_event<events::click>(click); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

In fact, a form_loader object can be passed to make_event because it is a functor. 
Take a look at above code: form would not be shown immediately after initialization, 
and the show() method is need to call explicitly after creating the form by form_loader. 
Therefore, only an invisible form created by the form_loader object we can get, if we pass 
the form_loader object like above code to the make_event. A way to achieve it is calling the 
show() method in that constructor of class, but in most instances, we are not enable to modify 
the code of the classes, and therefore we need a correct solution. The form_loader has two 
template parameters, the first is used for specifying a type of form, the second is a non-type 
template parameter and its type is bool named IsMakeVisible, used for determining whether making 
the form visible. So, we can specify the second template parameter by giving true, like this. 

	btn.make_event<events::click>(form_loader<form, true>()); 

\subsection mmodal Modal Form  
Modal form is a modality of forms. It would handle all interactions with the user 
while the form is active. This is what makes the form modal, the user can not interact 
with its owner window until the form is closed. Modal form is useful to block the program 
execution and wait for a user input. For example:

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp> 
	#include <iostream> 
	void foo(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm(ei.window, API::make_center(ei.window, 400, 300)); 
		fobj.caption(STR("I am a modal form")); 
		std::cout<<"Block execution till modal form is closed"<<std::endl; 
		API::modal_window(fm); 
		std::cout<<"modal form is closed"<<std::endl; 
	} 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		fm.caption(STR("Click me to open a modal form")); 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(foo); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

Call nana::gui::API::modal_window() to enable modal form. Only if an owner is 
specified for the form initialization, will the form enable as modal form. The 
object fm in function foo() is created and specified ei.window as its owner. The 
ei.window refers to the form that is defined in function main(), and passed by event argument. 





\section appear Appearance of Window 
A window has an appearance, the appearance can be specified when a window is being created. 
There is a structure named appearance to determine the appearance of a window. The definition of the structure is 

	struct appearance 
	{ 
		bool taskbar; 
		bool floating; 
		bool no_activate; 
		bool minimize; 
		bool maximize; 
		bool sizable; 
		bool decoration; 
	}; 

In practical development, the struct appearance is hard to describe what style of the appearance 
is, so Nana provides three templates class to generate an appearance object for readability and understandability.
 
	struct appear 
	{ 
		struct minimize; 
		struct maximize; 
		struct sizable; 
		struct taskbar; 
		struct floating; 
		struct no_activate; 
		template<   typename Minimize = null_type, 
					typename Maximize = null_type, 
					typename Sizable = null_type, 
					typename Floating = null_type, 
					typename NoActive = null_type   > struct decorate; 
		template<   typename Taskbar = null_type, 
					typename Floating = null_type, 
					typename NoActive = null_type, 
					typename Minimize = null_type, 
					typename Maximize = null_type, 
					typename Sizable = null_type   > struct bald; 
		template<   bool HasDecoration = true, 
					typename Taskbar = null_type, 
					typename Floating = null_type, 
					typename NoActive = null_type > struct optional; 
	}; 

These templates generate appearances, and every template receives the template parameters for specifying the attributes of appearance. 
template decorate is used for generating an appearance with a border and titlebar. 

![Figure 3.2 Decoration] (Decoration.jpg)

The appearance of Figure 3.2 that created by appear::decorate<>() has a titlebar and borders that are draw by platform window manager. 

![Figure 3.3 No decoration](noDecoration.jpg) 

The appearance of Figure 3.3 that created by appear::bald<>() has not a titlebar and 3D-look borders. 

The appearances of Figure 3.2 and 3.3 are created by templates without specifying the template parameters. 
Each template provides some parameters, and each template parameter name indicates what attribute is supported
by this template. Such as, template decorate, it receives the parameters are appear::minimize, appear::maximize, 
appear::sizable, appear::floating and appear::no_activate. For example, creating an appearance with decoration 
that has a minimize button and maximize button. See code blow. 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm(API::make_center(240, 160), 
		appear::decorate<appear::minimize, appear::maximize>()); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

![The appearance will be displayed like Figure 3.4] (minimize.jpg)

Figure 3.4 Decoration with minimize button and maximize button 

There is a feature for these templates: the order of template parameters does not affect 
the order of explicit specifying template parameters, the name of template parameters just 
tell you which attribute can affect the appearance. For example: 

appear::decorate<appear::minimize, appear::maximize>() creates an appearance that is the same as the result created by appear::decorate<appear::maximize, appear::minimize>().
 
appear::decorate<>() creates an appearance that is the same as appear::decorate<int, int, int, int, int>(), because the type of int is not wanted. 



\section event Event Handling  
Event is a messaging mechanism provided by the window system. Various kinds of 
events are generated by the window system for notifying the application. A key or 
mouse event is generated when the user presses or releases a key or mouse button, 
and the application can receive the event and response to user actions. 

The different window systems provide their own patterns of messaging mechanism. Nana 
implements an abstract pattern of event mechanism to hide the difference between different window systems. 

\subsection reg Registering and Unregistering an Event  
To response to the click action generated by any specified button, we need to make the click event for the button. 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	#include <nana/gui/widgets/button.hpp> 
	void foo() { } 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(foo); 
		exec(); 
	} 

As shown in above code, the make_event() is a member template of class widget, and it is 
used for registering an event handler. The above code makes a click event for the `form` object.
When the user clicks the body of the form, Nana is responsible for invoking the function `foo()` 
registered as a handler of the specified event. Additionally, the function `foo()` can be 
specified with a parameter of type `const nana::gui::eventinfo&` to receive the information 
of the event. The details of eventinfo are described in section 6.2. 

The make_event() returns a handle of event handler if the registration is successful. 
The type of the return value is nana::gui::event_handle. With the handle, we can delete the event handler manually. For example:

	event_handle handle = fm.make_event<events::click>(foo); 
	fm.umake_event(handle); 

After calling the umake_event(), the `foo()` function would be not invoked when the user clicks the body of form. 
In most situations, we could not take care of deleting the event handler, because the event handlers will be deleted while form is closed. 

\subsection eve Events 
An event type describes a specific event which is generated by Nana. For each event type, 
a corresponding class is defined by Nana, which is used for referring to an event type. 
The classes for event types are defined in the namespace nana::gui::events, such as `click`, `mouse_move` and so on. 

Every event contains some information. The information is sent to the application through a (const) reference to an `eventinfo` object in event handler. 

	#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp> 
	void foo(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	{ 
		//Refer to ei for information of event. 
	} 
	int main() 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		form fm; 
		fm.make_event<events::click>(foo); 
		fm.show(); 
		exec(); 
	} 

Nana.GUI provides some raw events, such as `click`, `mouse_move` and so on. 
Most of these events can work with all widgets implemented by Nana.GUI, but some of them are individual, 
like `unload` for `root widget` and `elapse` for `timer`.

Every widget has an interface for registering an event, named `make_event`.

	  template<typename Event, typename Function>
	event_handle make_event(Function) const;

	  template<typename Event, typename Class, typename Concept>
	event_handle make_event(Class& object, 
	   void (Concept::*mf)(const  nana::gui::eventinfo&));

	  template<typename Event, typename Class, typename Concept>
	event_handle make_event(Class& object, void(Concept::*mf)());

These template function calls explicitly specifies the first template parameter. 
The Event is a type defined by Nana.GUI in nana::gui::events. The events are:

Event			|	Description
----------------|---------------------------------------
click			| A mouse click event.
dbl_click		| A mouse double click event.
mouse_enter		| A mouse enters a widget.
mouse_move		| A mouse moves over a widget.
mouse_leave		| A mouse leaves a widget.
mouse_down		| A mouse button is pressed on a widget.
mouse_up		| A mouse button is released on a widget.
mouse_wheel		| A mouse scrolls the wheel on a widget.
mouse_drop		| A mouse release over a window that is registered as recipient of drag and drop.
size			| A widget's size is changing.
unload			| A form is closed by clicking the X button, only works for root widget.
destroy			| A widget is about to be destroyed.
focus			| A widget's focus is changed.
key_down		| A keyboard is pressed on a focus widget.
key_char		| The focus widget received a character.
key_up			| A keyboard is released on a focus widget.
shortkey		| The widgets received a shortkey message.
elapse			| A widget received a tick that is sended by timer.
				
An user-defined event function may have a parameter of type `const nana::gui::eventinfo&` for queering the event information, such as mouse position.

	void foo();
	void foo_with_parameter(const nana::gui::eventinfo&);
	class user_def_functor
	{ public:
	   void operator()(const nana::gui::eventinfo&); 		 //user-defined function must have the parameter.
	};
	nana::gui::button().make_event<nana::gui::events::click>(foo);
	nana::gui::button().make_event<nana::gui::events::click>(foo_with_parameter);
	nana::gui::button().make_event<nana::gui::events::click>(user_def_functor());

`make_event` returns a handle for uninstalling the associated user-defined event function and Nana.GUI destroys the 
user-defined event function automatically when the widget is beginning to destroy.

This just describes these raw events, but some widgets like nana::gui::treebox provides some high-level events, 
such as expanding a node. These details are only described in its reference. 

For different events, the `eventinfo` contains different structures for these event types. The following paragraphs describe the details of eventinfo. 

\subsubsection mous Mouse Events  
The mouse is an important and convenient input device. The user controls the mouse cursor 
on the screen through moving and clicking mouse. If the mouse cursor moves over on a widget, 
the system would generate a `mouse_move` event to notify the program to which the widget belongs. 
The structure of mouse events contains: 

	struct implemented-specified 
	{ 
		short x; 
		short y;            //point (x, y) coordinates in event widget 
		bool left_button;   //True if the left button is pressed. 
		bool mid_button;    //True if the middle button is pressed. 
		bool right_button;  //True if the right button is pressed. 
		bool shift;         //True if the shift key is pressed. 
		bool ctrl;          //True if the ctrl key is pressed. 
	}; 

The structure of mouse wheel event contains: 

	struct implemented-specified 
	{ 
		short x; 
		short y;            //point(x, y) coordinates in event widgets. 
		bool upwards;       //True if the wheel is upward rolls. 
		bool shift;         //True if the shift key is pressed 
		bool ctrl;          //True if ctrl key is pressed. 
	}; 

In an event handler function, we can refer to the structure by using eventinfo object. For example: 

	void foo(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	{ 
		using namespace nana::gui; 
		switch(ei.identifier) 
		{ default: ei.mouse;           //refers to the structure of mouse events. 
				 break; 
		case events::mouse_wheel::identifier: 
				ei.wheel;           //refers to the structure of mouse_wheel event. 
				break; 
		} 
	} 

To receive a mouse event, register the event with a specific class which is defined in namespace nana::gui::events. 

	click/dbl_click 

When the user clicks mouse and the mouse cursor is in a widget, the widget receives a click event that is generated by Nana. 

	mouse_enter/mouse_move/mouse_leave 

This event is sent to a widget when the mouse cursor enters/leaves the widget. 

	mouse_down/mouse_up 

This event is sent when the user presses/releases/moves the mouse while the mouse cursor is in a widget. 


\subsubsection Keyboard Keyboard Events  


There are three different kinds of keyboard events in Nana C++ Library: key down, key up and character key down. 

A window system usually uses an input focus to represent a window which would receive the keyboard events. 
In general, a window which user clicks would be set to the input focus widow in Nana C++ Library. 
Additionally, the program can determinate which window gets the input focus by calling `nana::gui::API::set_focus()` .
 
The structure of keyboard event contains:
 
	struct implemented-specified 
	{ 
	  mutable nana::char_t 	key; 
	  mutable nana::bool 	ignore; 
	  unsigned char 		ctrl; 
	}; 

As the definition shown, the member `key` and `ignore` are defined as `mutable`, the feature will be explained later. 

	key_down/key_up 

When the users hit the keyboard, the `key_down` would be generated when a key is pressed down, and the `mouse_up`
would be generated when the pressed key is released. 

	key_char 

The `key_char` event is an abstract event. A window system usually translates the keys into characters. For example, to type a 
Chinese character one usually needs to hit in the keyboard more than one key and the window system translates these keys into a Chinese 
character and then a `key_char` event is generated and sent to the program. 
The two members, `key` and `ignore`, are defined as `mutable` in the structure of key event. It is used to modify the state of `key_char` event. 
During `key_char` processing, if the member `ignore` is set to `true`, Nana will igore the key. For example, when a program is designed 
to receive the number input, the program should test the key in key_char event, and set the `ignore` to true if the input char is not a digital.
Likein the  below code: 

	void only_digital_allowed(const nana::gui::eventinfo& ei) 
	{ 
		ei.ignore = (ei.key < '0' || ei.key > '9'); 
	}
